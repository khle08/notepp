# What is httplib?

`httplib` is a header-only library that enable us to start up a http server/client quickly in few lines of code. This lib includes all the regular methods and operations for constructing an API backend system. More examples are demonstrated in the [link](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib). 





# How to run?

Go to the folder `10-https` and run the following system script :

```bash
./build.sh
```

and the compilation and executable file will be automatically done and generated. If the project has been run before and you want to clean up the remaining files in `build` folder, use the following cmd:

```bash
./build.sh rm
```
