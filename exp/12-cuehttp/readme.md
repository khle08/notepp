# What is cuehttp?

`cuehttp` is a header-only library for both http and websocket requests. This library is by far the most powerful and simple-to-use program available on the internet. 




# How to run?

Go to the folder `12-cuehttp` and run the following system script :

```bash
./build.sh
```

and the compilation and executable file will be automatically done and generated. If the project has been run before and you want to clean up the remaining files in `build` folder, use the following cmd:

```bash
./build.sh rm
```
