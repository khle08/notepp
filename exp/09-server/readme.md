# What is Eigen?

Eigen (click [here](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) to head to the official website) is an open-source linear algebra library implemented in C++. Itâ€™s fast and well-suited for a wide range of tasks, from heavy numerical computation, to simple vector arithmetic. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the features of Eigen required for implementing graphics applications, to readers possessing basic knowledge of C++, linear algebra, and computer graphics.



# How to run?

Go to the folder `exp-eigen` and run the following system script :

```bash
./build.sh
```

and the compilation and executable file will be automatically done and generated.
